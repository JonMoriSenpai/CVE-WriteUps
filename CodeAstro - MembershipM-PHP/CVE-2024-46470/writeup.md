## 🛑 Impact
- **Data Theft:** Attackers can steal sensitive data such as session cookies.

## 🔒 Solution

1. **Input Validation:**
   - Ensure proper input validation to filter out any JavaScript or HTML tags:
     ```php
     $membership_type = htmlspecialchars($input, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8');
     ```

2. **Output Encoding:**
   - Ensure the output is encoded before rendering it on the webpage.

3. **Use Content Security Policy (CSP):**
   - Set a CSP header to prevent the execution of malicious scripts:
     ```http
     Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self';
     ```

4. **Sanitize User Input:**
   - Use libraries like **HTML Purifier** to sanitize the inputs:
     ```php
     $purifier = new HTMLPurifier();
     $clean_html = $purifier->purify($input);
     ```

## 🧑‍🔧 Conclusion

This stored XSS vulnerability in `MembershipM-PHP` allows attackers to persistently inject malicious scripts. It can affect all users accessing the page and lead to significant security risks. Implementing proper input validation, output encoding, and a secure CSP policy will mitigate this vulnerability and prevent future exploitation.
